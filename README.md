# Uber Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber's raw data for the time period from January to December 2016. The dataset includes information on Uber drives in two countries: USA and UK. The dataset contains essential details such as Start Date, End Date, Start Location, End Location, Miles Driven, and Purpose of the drive (Business, Personal, Meals, Errands, Meetings, Customer Support, etc.).

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to gain valuable insights from Uber's data and visualize the patterns and trends in the rides across different locations and purposes. We aim to understand ride patterns, peak hours, popular locations, and the distribution of ride purposes to help Uber optimize their services and improve customer satisfaction.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before proceeding with the analysis, we have performed rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and filtering out irrelevant information for countries other than the USA and the UK. The cleaned and processed dataset is used as the basis for our analysis.

## Visualization

For visualization and analysis, we utilized Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. The Power BI report provides interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow us to explore the Uber data comprehensively. The visualizations include:

- **Geographical Analysis**: Interactive maps displaying the distribution of rides across different locations in the USA and the UK.

- **Time-based Analysis**: Line charts and bar graphs showcasing ride trends over different months and hours of the day.

- **Purpose Analysis**: Pie charts and bar graphs to illustrate the distribution of rides based on different purposes such as business, personal, meals, etc.

## Project Files

This repository contains the following files:

- `Uber.pbix`: The Power BI file with the visualizations and interactive reports.

- `PDF`: A PDF document providing a snapshot of the Power BI visualizations.

## Usage

To explore the visualizations and insights, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. Open the `Uber.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

3. Interact with the visuals and explore various insights by selecting filters and slicers.

## Conclusion

The Uber Data Analytics project offers valuable insights into Uber's ride patterns in the USA and the UK during the period of January to December 2016. The visualizations provide a clear picture of peak hours, popular locations, and ride purposes, enabling Uber to make data-driven decisions for service enhancements and customer satisfaction.
